##Synthetic Categories for Vessel Comparison

Synthkat is a computational initiative to construct flexible,
synthetic categories of established ceramic and glass vessel
classifications and typologies of the ancient Roman world.
Project files and algorithms are available for use under the
GNU Public License v. 3.0.

The current pilot script uses the following libraries:
- [numpy](https://www.numpy.org)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org)
- [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
- [matplotlub.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/)

Synthkat is a work in progress. Initial focus has been on
second- and first-century BCE Italy, but the design of
Synthkat is to be aggregative, toward encompassing ever
larger datasets. The first set of pilot data in .csv,
.json, and .txt format, as well as scripts in python,
are available on https://github.com/scollinselliott/synthkat.

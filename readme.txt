#Synthkat is a computational initiative to construct flexible, synthetic categories of established ceramic and glass vessel classifications and typologies of the ancient Roman world. Project files and algorithms are available for use under the GNU Public License v. 3.0.

#Synthkat is a work in progress. Initial focus has been on second- and first-century BCE Italy, but the design of Synthkat is to be aggregative, toward encompassing ever larger datasets. The first set of pilot data in .csv and .txt format, as well as scripts in python, are available on https://github.com/scollinselliott/synthkat.
